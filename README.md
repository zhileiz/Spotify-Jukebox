# Homework 9: Spotify Jukebox
Due **March 27, 2017 11:59pm**.

The assignment is available for download [here](cis196_homework_9.zip).

## Before Starting
Be sure to review [lecture 9](//seas.upenn.edu/~cis196/lectures/CIS196-2017s-lecture9.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Task
In this homework assignment, you will be creating a Jukebox using data from the Spotify API. You will be able to create new artists and songs with Spotify players to listen to the music.

Similar to the previous rails homework, you can run `rails s` to test the your program. Alternatively, you can run `rails c` to run the console directly.

### Models and Migrations
You will create models for `Artist` and `Song`. These models will have basic validations upon creation. An artist should have many songs and a song should belong to an artist. For this homework, you will be writing your own migrations. The homework uses a persistent SQLite database for development purposes. You will want to use `rails g` to create migrations for the two models. `Artist` should have the attribute `name`, and `Song` should have the attributes `name` and `artist_id`. Remember to `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` the provided data. To delete the database at any time, run `rake db:drop`.

### Gems
`gem install bundler` if you haven’t already and run the `bundle` command. This will install all gems listed in your `Gemfile`.

### Spotify API
For this homework, we will be using the Spotify API. Spotify provides us with JSON data to access and embedded all songs and artists within its library. Before you start this assignment, familiarize yourself with the API by exploring [https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/user-guide/](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/user-guide/){:target="_blank"}. When you want JSON for a specific artist, you can access this information by following the general format `https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=SOME+ARTIST&type=artist` where you provide the specific artist name. When you want JSON for a specific song, you can access this information by following the general format `https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=SOME+SONG+SOME+ARTIST&type=track` where you provide the specific artist name and song name. To access the JSON data as a hash, call `JSON.load`, and pass it to `open(url)`, where url is a string of the url you want to access.

### artist.rb
Artist should be instantiated by being passed a name. Artist should have validated the artist name using the Spotify API with the `in_spotify?` method. If the artist is not valid, the artist should not be created. The artist should have many songs. When an artist is destroyed, all songs belonging to the artist should be destroyed. You should be able to create an artist without a valid song.

#### artist_search
An `artist` should have a method named `artist_search` that will format an artist name so that it can be used with the Spotify URI. Artist names should be formatted by inserting `+` instead of spaces.

#### in_spotify?
An `artist` should also have a method named `in_spotify?` that will check for a valid artist. An artist is valid if an artist has items in the Spotify API. You should use the artist search to check the Spotify API. To validate an artist, you will need to load the `JSON` from the provided link. For artists, use the type `artist` as the search field. You should interpolate the result of `artist_search` in the `search?q=` field of the url. Once you retrieve the proper `JSON`, you can validate an artist by checking if within the hash `artists`, `items` is empty.

#### add_song
An `artist` should have a method named `add_song` that takes in `artist_params`. This is a helper method for `create`. This method will be called on an instance of artist in the controller. Initialize a song from `song_attributes` within `artist params`. Set the artist of the song to the current artist and add the song to the the artist's `songs` if the song is `in_spotify?`. If the song is not `in_spotify?`, do not add it to the artist (so the artist instance will be created without any song) and return `false`. Save the instance of the artist and return `true`.

### song.rb
A `song` should be instantiated by being passed the name of the song. A song should validate the song name using the Spotify API and the method `in_spotify?`. If the song is not valid, a song should not be created. The song should belong to an artist. Since we want to make nested resources for songs, songs should only be able to be created from an artist `show` page. When a song is destroyed, the artist it belongs to should not be destroyed.

#### in_spotify?
A `song` should also have a method named `in_spotify?` that will check for a valid song. A song is valid if a song has items in the Spotify API. To validate a song, you will need to load the `JSON` from the provided link. For songs, use the type `track` as the search field. You should interpolate the result from `song_search` in the `search?q=` field of the url. Don't forget that once you retrieve the proper `JSON`, you can validate a song by checking if within the hash `tracks`, `items` is empty.

#### song_search
A `song` should have a method named `song_search` that will format an artist name and a song name so that it can be used with the Spotify URI. Song names and artist name should be formatted by inserting `+` instead of spaces.

#### spotify_uri
A `song` should have a method `spotify_uri` that will use the return value from `song_search` and properly parse through the JSON from Spotify. You will want to get the song information by using the type track and pulling the first URI from the first item.

#### add_artist
A `song` should have a method named `add_artist` that takes in `song_params`. This is a helper method for `create`. This method will be called on an instance of song in the controller. In this method, you should find an artist based on `artist_id` within params. Set the artist of the song equal to the artist you just found. Check if the current song is `in_spotify?`. If the song is valid, save the song as one of the artist's songs and return `true`. Otherwise, this method should return `false`.

### Spotify URI
Spotify players can be embedded into `erb` files by using `iframe` with specific sources. To specifically access Spotify information, you will want to use the general url: `https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=`. At the end of this link, you will want to interpolate the result of `spotify_uri`.

### Routes
You should make `Song` a nested resource of `Artist`. This means you should update your `routes` so that a song can be accessed only through the provided artist. Make sure you created nested routes in your `routes.rb` file. In addition, you should not be able to `update` or `edit` songs and artists. You should make this respective changes in your controllers and `routes.rb`. Also, you should create a new route in the `SongsController` where the `all` action handles a GET request to /songs.

### Controllers
You should generate `ArtistsController` and `SongsController` with full REST, except for the `update` and `edit` actions.

#### ArtistsController
Remember that in the `create` route, you should check if the artist is in spotify before saving it and adding songs to it. If the route is too long, feel free to delete the `format.json` lines since we are not expecting to respond with JSON.

#### SongsController
Remember that in the `create` route, the success of the route is determined by the success of adding an artist.

### Views
The views were provided to you almost completely intact. You will only have to write the `_form` files for both `artist` and `song`. Reference them for variable naming and to see how data are passed between the client and the server.

#### Artist Form
Since a song can only be made through an artist, you will need to write a nested form. There should be a text area for `name` for the artist. In addition, you will need a field for `song_attributes` and `song_name`. This will require you to iterate over `song_attributes`. When creating this form, be mindful of the paths you are using for the nested attributes.

#### Song Form
This form is not as complicated as `artist` because it only accepts a `name` field for song. However, make sure you remember that the form can be used for a new song and the song from the artist.

### Uploading
Just run `rake zip` to generate the files.zip file you should upload.
